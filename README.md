# Static Web Pages Project

This project contains multiple static web pages designed using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. It showcases various web designs and layouts with background images sourced from NxtWave Academy. As an academy student, I have utilized these resources to enhance the visual appeal of the web pages.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files and directories:

- `index.html`: The main homepage of the project.
- `styles.css`: Custom CSS styles for the project.
- `images/`: Directory containing preview images used in the project.
- `bootstrap`: Bootstrap CDN for responsive design.(<link rel="stylesheet"

## Features

- **HTML & CSS**: Basic structure and styling of the web pages.
- **Bootstrap**: Utilized for responsive design and layout.
- **CCBP UI Kit**: Used for smooth navigation and UI components.
- **Background Images**: Sourced from [NxtWave Academy], where I am a student. These images are used to enhance the visual aesthetics of the pages.Images links are in the code and images are not provided in the folder.

## Usage

To view the web pages, simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser. You can navigate through the pages using the provided navigation bar, which is powered by the CCBP UI Kit. I suggest you to open in mobile cause all the pages are designed in mobile view. You can also use personal computer/laptop.

## Preview

Preview images of the web pages are located in the `images/` directory. These images provide a quick glance at the design and layout of each page.
